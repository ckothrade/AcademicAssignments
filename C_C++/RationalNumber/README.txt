*Assignment: Assignment 2 (rational)

*Description: Objects of this class represent rational numbers; that is, fractions of the form (integer)/(integer). Every funcion in this class, including constructors, ensures that the denominator will never become zero. This class automatically normalizes any rational input into it; it will always ensure that the fraction is reduced fully and that the negative sign will only show up in front of the numerator. Operator overloads for a wide variety of operators are provided; see the class body below. Various constructors are included to allow you to initialize objects of class rational in a variety of ways
