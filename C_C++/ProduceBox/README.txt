*Assignment: Assignment 2 (produce)

*Description: This program contains the BoxOfProduce class, objects of which represent boxes of produce
each containing 3 bundles of some type of fruit or vegetable.  The main function of this program tests the 
BoxOfProduce class by creating an object of BoxOfProduce, filling it with three bundles randomly selected from
five different options for type of fruit or vegetable: Broccoli, Tomato, Kiwi, Kale, or Tomatillo.  The user
is then presented with the option to choose one of the bundles and substitute in its place a new bundle chosen
from one of the five options listed above.  The user is allowed to substitute bundles as many times as they want. After the user is finished substituting, they are given the option to create a new BoxOfProduce and start the process over again.  The BoxOfProduce class keeps track of how many boxes have been created so far and displays this value to the user.
