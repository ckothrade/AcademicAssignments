*Assignment: Assignment 3 (reverse)

*Description: This program contains a function that utilizes pointers to reverse a string that has been input by the user. One pointer points to the first element of the string, and the second pointer points to the last character in the string before the terminating null.  The function procedes along; incrementing the pointers, swapping the "head" and "tail" elements one by one, until the head pointer >= the tail pointer.
